Written Report
In this analysis, school performance, as measured by math and reading scores, was analyzed with input from various datapoints such as school size, budget, and school type.

The analysis indicates that the five highest-performing schools, as measured by the percentage of students who passed both the reading and math tests, were all charter schools, while the bottom-performing schools were all schools in districts. Budget analysis indicated that while some of the schools who spent the highest amounts per students had some of the highest overall passing rates, there were also many of the schools spending the lowest amounts per students with similar passing rates. For example, while Pena High School had a lower budget than Rodriguez high school, Pena High School's overall passing rate was 90.5%, while Rodriguez High School's passing rate was only 53.0%.
